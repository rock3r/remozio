# Private command child

The app embeds a small C executable for credential preparation in a fresh child process.
Root will use public `posix_spawn` instead of forking its multithreaded Swift runtime.
This executable grants no authority to an ordinary caller and has no request listener.
The product authority does not launch it yet.

    participant R as Root request owner
    participant C as Fresh command child
    participant P as Approved program
    R->>C: Spawn with private pipes and retained descriptors
    R->>C: Exact capture and finite preparation budget
    C->>C: Validate frame; set and verify target credentials
    C->>C: Enter retained directory; prepare selected I/O
    C-->>R: Prepared status on private pipe
    Note over R: Parent supervision and dispatch checks remain to implement
    R->>R: Consume durable permit; enforce current policy; final recheck
    R->>C: One private release byte
    C->>P: execve captured pathname, raw argv and environment
    Note over R,P: Status pipe closure alone does not prove exec or command exit
```

## Descriptor contract

The parent must authenticate the installed executable and supply only these descriptors.
It must create a separate process group, reset inherited signals and use a clean launcher environment.
PTY mode also requires a new session and a private terminal slave.

| Descriptor | Use |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Original stdin, or the selected PTY slave |
| 1 | Original stdout, or the selected PTY slave |
| 2 | Original stderr, or the selected PTY slave |
| 3 | Private configuration pipe, read end |
| 4 | Retained working directory |
| 5 | Private status pipe, write end |
| 6 | Private release pipe, read end |

The child requires real and effective UID zero before touching these descriptors.
It validates private pipe direction, closes other descriptors, and marks control descriptors close-on-exec.
It changes nonblocking flags only on private pipes. It does not read stdin or write stdout/stderr during preparation.
The directory is entered after dropping credentials, so possession of its descriptor does not bypass target access checks.
The parent must normalize borrowed sources before mapping descriptors to avoid source/destination collisions.
No parent spawner or installed service satisfies that contract yet.

## Private frame

Format 1 uses a 40-byte header of ten big-endian UInt32 words.
The complete frame is bounded at 8 MiB. Argument and environment counts are each bounded at 262,144 entries.

| Header word | Value |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | `0x524d4331` (`RMC1`) |
| 1 | Exact body byte count |
| 2–3 | Target UID and primary GID |
| 4 | Supplementary group count |
| 5–6 | Argument and environment counts |
| 7 | Preparation budget in milliseconds, 100–60,000 |
| 8 | Explicit policy-supplied umask, 0000–0777 |
| 9 | I/O mode: 0 for pipes, 1 for PTY |

The body contains raw supplementary group IDs, then the absolute executable pathname, arguments and sorted `NAME=value` entries.
Each string has a UInt32 byte length. Empty arguments and values, custom argv[0], and non-UTF-8 bytes remain exact.
NULs, duplicate or unsorted environment names, relative executable paths, unknown formats and trailing bytes fail.
The private frame conveys captured data. It is not a permit or public command protocol.

The child requires EOF after the complete frame. Partial frames and stalled writers have finite deadlines.
The same sleep-inclusive preparation deadline covers credential setup, status and waiting for release.
This deadline does not limit a successfully executed command's runtime.
Temporary decoded string storage is wiped on explicit cleanup. This does not promise erasure of allocator or kernel copies.

## Darwin group handling

Darwin stores the effective primary GID in the first group slot.
Its empty `setgroups` path substitutes group zero. An empty supplementary list must therefore not become `setgroups(0, ...)`.
The child normalizes the approved primary GID first, then adds only unique approved supplementary GIDs.
It rejects unions above Darwin's 16-entry limit.
It sets groups, GID and UID, then verifies real/effective IDs and the complete actual group list.

This follows Apple's [XNU credential implementation](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/main/bsd/kern/kern_credential.c)
and [credential syscalls](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/main/bsd/kern/kern_prot.c).
Upstream source inspection and pure decoder tests do not prove privileged behavior on the installed or minimum supported OS.

## Release and outcomes

The private status record has three big-endian UInt32 words: magic `0x524d5231`, tag and errno.
Tag 1 means prepared with errno zero. Tag 2 means preparation or exec failed with the reported errno.
The child writes no command output for these records.
Only release byte 1 permits `execve`. EOF, another value or deadline exhaustion prevents dispatch.
There is no extra shell, interpreter substitution, inherited service environment or automatic retry.

The status descriptor closes on successful exec. EOF alone cannot distinguish exec from a process death.
The parent supervisor must establish actual exec/exit evidence before reporting a command exit status or signal.
It must retain the original request, handle caller lifetime, forward signals, cancel the process group and support terminal resize.
Those integrations remain required, along with durable permit ownership and current elevation policy.
Pathname execution retains the user-approved replacement race after the final identity/content check.

## Validation limits

Ten focused tests cover raw-byte preservation, malformed frames, cleanup and Darwin group normalization.
Debug and Release packaging checks verify the embedded signature, runtime, architecture and macOS 26 deployment target.
The refusal check proves a non-root caller cannot consume stdin or write command output.
No privileged command, Root listener, service registration, PTY session or physical device was activated.
Protected installation, Developer ID distribution and interactive credential/terminal checks remain open.
