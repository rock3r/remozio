# Experiment sequence

The [design specification](https://remozio-plan.seebrock3r.chatgpt.site/) defines the product. Experiments establish evidence before implementation relies on platform behavior.

| Work | Status | Next evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Android biometric key | [Debug probe prepared](android-biometric-key.md) | Per-use hardware authentication, cancellation, enrollment retention, and update continuity on a Pixel |
| Swift/Kotlin approval flow | [Synthetic peer harness](approval-flow.md) | Durable admission, real enrollment, encrypted transport, and device keys |
| Swift build and XPC identity checks | [Measured with ad-hoc signing](macos-xpc.md) | macOS 26 and Developer ID repeats |
| Single app and background services | [Bundle build and seals checked](macos-packaging.md) | SMAppService registration, protected placement, update replacement |
| Keys and durable authority | [Disposable enclave signing and restoration measured](macos-key-custody.md) | Pre-login availability, code access, crash and rollback cases |
| Journal consumption and recovery | [Process-crash boundaries measured](macos-authority-journal.md) | Protected local checkpoint, physical durability, production recovery |
| Command executable binding | [Path replacement and descriptor behavior measured](macos-execution-binding.md) | Accepted pathname/recheck contract; protected executor integration |
| Streaming encrypted channel | [TLS](tls-channel.md) and [WebSocket carrier](websocket-carrier.md) harnesses | Android keys, Cloudflare integration, protected identities, and reconnect |
| Native TLS key custody | [Disposable enclave identity and TLS exchange measured](macos-enclave-tls.md) | macOS 26 runtime, pre-login access, protected service identity, Android hardware peer |
| Presence signals | [One-shot probe prepared](macos-presence.md) | GUI-session observations, remote desktop usability, lock and brightness support |
| UI adapters | Needs interactive session | Authorized dialog fixtures |
| Per-Mac push and tunnel | Pending configuration | FCM delivery and independent Mac endpoints |
| Android ADB bridge | [Endpoint probe prepared](android-adb-endpoint.md) | Discovery, Wi-Fi-off fallback, listener exposure, foreground lifetime, reconnect and Stop |
| Setup exports and APK updates | Pending | Independent import, signature checks and retained pairing |

## PR sequence

1. Reproducible native Mac experiment harness and XPC evidence.
2. Build and CI infrastructure for Mac experiments, followed by app/service packaging experiments.
3. Protocol and state-machine implementation, driven by shared Swift/Kotlin conformance vectors.
4. Privileged authority and transport integration after the relevant evidence gates pass.
5. Prompt adapters, Android approval flow, push, and ADB in separate vertical changes.

Each PR records its checks and limits. An experiment result does not certify an untested configuration. Device-dependent end-to-end tests are reserved for the user's next available computer session.

## Accepted limits

The [2026-10-03 decisions](../design-decisions.md) exclude whole-Mac backup rollback and accept pathname execution after a final recheck. Other security and recovery requirements remain. Pixel checks come first; Mac service and session-state tests come last.

## Interactive session preparation

Use the [interactive handoff](interactive-handoff.md) as the single checklist for the session. It separates prepared probes from work that still needs fixtures or integration.

Before starting:

- Confirm an Apple Silicon Mac with macOS 26 or later and a supported Pixel with Android 17 or later. Record the actual OS versions; macOS 26 compatibility still needs a macOS 26 host.
- Choose the artifacts and signing identities named by the relevant procedure. Keep private signing keys on their intended devices.
- Agree on each device-setting change. Use disposable keys and synthetic requests.

### Prepared checks

The handoff's [first-session checklist](interactive-handoff.md#first-session-prepared-checks) covers app surfaces, the biometric probe, ADB endpoint discovery/reachability, XPC, enclave signing and loopback TLS. Follow each linked procedure and its cleanup steps.

The ADB endpoint probe does not enable a listener or implement the bridge. Its Wi-Fi-off check needs an explicitly provisioned endpoint. It cannot establish bridge recovery after an app update or restart.

### Later checks

The handoff's [later-session checklist](interactive-handoff.md#later-sessions-fixtures-or-integration-still-needed) preserves the tests for protected services, authority continuity, prompt adapters, presence, cloud delivery, enrollment, ADB and updates. These are not runnable product operations yet.

Service registration, lock/logout/reboot behavior, update replacement, authorized prompt fixtures and remote-desktop presence need their implementation and procedures first. The complete bridge must also support Wi-Fi-off operation, reconnect and explicit Stop before its end-to-end tests.

Do not collect passwords, ADB payloads, notification tokens, or provider secrets in committed evidence. Use the handoff's [evidence record](interactive-handoff.md#evidence-record) for results and limitations.
