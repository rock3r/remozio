# Ubuntu foundation validation and operator handoff

This work implements experiments and protocol portability, not an installed Linux
host. The [Phase 0 proposal](linux-host-contract.md) keeps Ubuntu 25.10 compatibility
in scope and leaves the production caller guarantee and Linux wire extension open.
The updated [contributor guide](https://gist.github.com/rock3r/ef069bbc6f931b83febf2e1c159cdbfa)
keeps the optional remote ADB bridge separate from the first approval flow.

## Recorded local checkpoint

On 17 October 2026, Ubuntu 25.10 x86_64, kernel `6.17.0-41-generic`:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/check.sh`, system Python 3.13 | 165 repository tests, six explicit skips; 221 watcher tests passed. Run outside the socket-restricted execution sandbox. |
| Existing Swift protocol suite | 119 tests passed; all 25 shared fixture files unchanged. |
| Caller experiment | 31 observations and four cleanup checks passed; all nine focused tests passed with live checks enabled. |
| TPM/provider TLS and hardware-adapter control | Private simulator controls and eleven focused unit tests passed. Supervised `/dev/tpmrm0` create/reopen, signing and mutual TLS also passed, including the same keys after an operator reboot. |
| Linux-runnable Kotlin/Android tasks | Passed with JDK 21 and SDK 37; Gradle reused unchanged task results. Debug APK and lint tasks succeeded. |
| Original unconditional Gradle gate | Blocked on Linux by four absent Mac peers; replaced by the host-aware gate below. |
| Mac checks and remote CI | Not run; the added Linux protocol CI job is prepared only. |

The linked experiment reports bind their results to source hashes and record the
limits. These results do not establish a protected installation or real approval
execution. At this checkpoint the original unconditional local gate blocked Linux
pushes. The host-aware local gate below replaces that requirement while retaining
Mac CI checks before merge.

## Independent checks

Use Python 3.11 or later, Swift 6.2 or later, JDK 21, and an Android SDK containing
platform `android-37.0` and build tools `37.0.0`. The shell's `python3` must select
the intended interpreter; this machine's `/usr/bin/python3` is 3.13, while another
Python earlier on its default PATH is older.

```sh
./scripts/check.sh
./scripts/check-linux-protocol.sh
python3 scripts/run-linux-caller-experiment.py
./gradlew :protocol-kotlin:test :phone-core:test :android-app:testDebugUnitTest :android-app:assembleDebug :android-app:lintDebug
```

The caller runner uses only disposable processes in the current account. Its live
checks need ordinary Unix sockets and tracing of its own children; restricted
execution sandboxes may deny those operations. Such a denial is a failed or
unavailable experiment, not successful identity validation. Do not change global
ptrace or security policy to obtain a pass.

The [Swift experiment](experiments/linux-swift-protocol.md) records an isolated
official toolchain and the additional userspace libraries needed on Ubuntu 25.10.
The [caller experiment](experiments/linux-caller.md) records exact positive checks,
timeouts, cleanup and untested cases. The [TPM/TLS experiment](experiments/linux-tpm-tls.md)
has separate dependency and invocation instructions; simulator results must remain
labelled as simulator results. None of these commands installs a production daemon.

## Local gate and CI coverage

The [repository pre-push requirement](../AGENTS.md) is one manual command that
selects the checks executable on the current host. No Git hook is installed:

```sh
./scripts/check-local.sh
```

It runs `scripts/check.sh` first on both hosts. Linux also runs
`scripts/check-linux-protocol.sh`. Both run the portable Kotlin/phone tests and
Android unit tests, debug assembly and lint. macOS additionally runs
`:phone-core:approvalFlowTest` after `check.sh` has built its native peers.
Unknown platforms and any failed phase fail the gate immediately.

The complete Linux coordinator passed on this Ubuntu 25.10 host with the prepared
Swift 6.2.4 runtime, JDK 21 and Android SDK 37: 171 repository tests (six skips),
221 watcher tests, 119 Swift tests, and all portable Kotlin/Android tasks. Gradle
reused 60 unchanged tasks and executed lint. The repository tests include six new
controls for Linux/macOS command selection, running from another directory,
unsupported hosts and failure propagation. Their stubbed macOS commands test
selection only; they do not claim a native Mac run for this revision.

`ApprovalFlowPeer`, `TLSPeer`, `HPKEPeer` and `AuditFlowPeer` are macOS executables
built from `experiments/approval-flow`. Linux does not substitute or skip their
Gradle task: it runs the portable tasks locally, and the complete native
interoperability suite remains required in Mac CI before merge. Explicitly invoking
`:phone-core:approvalFlowTest` still fails when the peers are absent.

All automated local checks map to jobs in
[checks.yml](../.github/workflows/checks.yml), triggered on pull requests and pushes
to `main` without path filters:

| Local check | CI job and command |
| --- | --- |
| Repository Python and PR-watcher tests | **Python checks**: `./scripts/check.sh` on Ubuntu; also runs on Mac. |
| Linux Swift protocol fixtures | **Linux Swift protocol**: `./scripts/check-linux-protocol.sh` on Ubuntu 24.04. |
| Mac native builds, experiments, Swift protocol and core tests | **Mac build**: the complete Darwin branch of `./scripts/check.sh` on macOS 26. |
| Portable Kotlin protocol and phone tests | **Kotlin protocol**: `:protocol-kotlin:test :phone-core:test`. |
| Native Swift/Kotlin interoperability | **Mac interoperability**: builds all four peers from the checkout, then runs `:phone-core:test :phone-core:approvalFlowTest`. |
| Android unit tests, debug assembly and lint | **Android build**: `:android-app:testDebugUnitTest :android-app:assembleDebug :android-app:lintDebug`, plus the additional CI-only `:android-app:assembleRelease`. |

The PR watcher's `local_gate` uses the same coordinator and its `required_checks`
includes all six job names. The original five jobs passed in upstream
[Checks run 39034970117](https://github.com/rock3r/remozio/actions/runs/39034970117)
for base revision `2d00126c8ce010f356a5de0db8e432dd37b504cc`. This branch's added
Linux Swift job has been validated locally but has not yet run remotely.
CI configuration and historical base results do not establish a pass for this branch.

Mac automated validation therefore does not require a friend's machine before a
Linux push; it remains a merge gate on the PR revision. The XPC GUI checks and
device-dependent experiments still require their specified interactive operator
sessions. A passing local Linux gate does not establish Mac runtime compatibility.

## Human testing boundary

Supervised `/dev/tpmrm0` creation, fresh-process reopen, signing and mutual TLS,
including reuse of the same keys after the operator's reboot,
passed with the operator's temporary per-user device ACL. The
[device checkpoint](experiments/linux-tpm-tls-device-evidence.json) records all negative
controls, unchanged retained records and unchanged persistent/NV handle listings.
The boot identifier changed, and all retained records matched their original hashes
before and after the reboot test. The same two keys signed and verified, and mutual
TLS plus all negative controls passed. No replacement keys were generated.
Protected service access, resource contention and physical cross-machine controls
remain separate device-dependent checks.
The [operator procedure](experiments/linux-tpm-tls.md#prepared-human-hardware-gate) requires
explicit hardware mode, authorized ordinary-user resource-manager access and
known-empty owner authorization for this provider adapter. Unknown or nonempty
owner authorization is unsupported by this adapter; do not guess it or reset it.
It must use disposable objects and verify the expected public identities. Do not
clear the TPM, reset ownership, evict unrelated handles, or automatically replace
an existing trusted host identity. Simulator keys and state are disposable fixtures;
they must never be enrolled as a production identity.

Record create/reopen, signing, mutual authentication, negative peers, unavailable
hardware and bounded resource behavior. The recorded reboot retention applies only
to the disposable fixture on this selected device. Protected service access and
physical cross-machine copied-record rejection still need explicit controls. A real TPM
result does not establish a protected Linux installation or a phone approval flow.
Using `/dev/tpmrm0` is device-path evidence, not physical-hardware attestation;
the operator must identify the test platform accurately, including any virtual TPM.

For future repeats, the retained fixture is under the operator's private user state directory,
`~/.local/state/remozio-experiments/tpm-tls-fixture`. Keep it through the reboot;
reuse must not regenerate either key. Sibling files retain the before-boot identity
hashes and boot comparison metadata. The `runtime-debs` sibling preserves the
isolated runtime packages and `runtime-package-hashes.json` records their checksums
so the same runtime can be restored if `/tmp` is cleared. After returning, re-establish
the temporary device ACL if needed, verify the public prerequisites and package
hashes, compare the boot identity, and run the documented `--reuse-fixture` invocation
with `--operator-phase after-reboot`. Publish comparison booleans only, never
the raw boot identifier or retained key records. Remove the temporary ACL after
the supervised tests finish.

Physical Pixel pairing and biometrics become actionable after the Linux services,
negotiated capture contract and executor are implemented. The current experiments
are not ready to approve or run real user commands. Privileged installation,
service activation, reboot and phone interaction remain supervised milestones.

## Review boundaries

Keep the design proposal, caller experiment, TPM experiment and shared protocol
portability independently reviewable. Coordinate shared schema work before assigning
wire tags; the [capture proposal](linux-capture-proposal.md) gives the concrete
upstream decisions and required fixtures. Submit implementation PRs sequentially and use the repository PR watcher
for readiness. Hardware results, Mac validation and schema agreement remain explicit
gates rather than implied consequences of unit-test success.
