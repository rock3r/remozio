# Ubuntu foundation validation and operator handoff

This work implements experiments and protocol portability, not an installed Linux
host. The [Phase 0 proposal](linux-host-contract.md) keeps Ubuntu 25.10 compatibility
in scope and leaves the production caller guarantee open. Linux capture schema 4
and Android interpretation are now defined by the
[accepted contract](linux-capture-proposal.md); they do not enable host issuance.
The updated [contributor guide](https://gist.github.com/rock3r/ef069bbc6f931b83febf2e1c159cdbfa)
keeps the optional remote ADB bridge separate from the first approval flow.

## Recorded local checkpoint

On 17 October 2026, Ubuntu 25.10 x86_64, kernel `6.17.0-41-generic`:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/check.sh`, system Python 3.13 | 165 repository tests, six explicit skips; 221 watcher tests passed. Run outside the socket-restricted execution sandbox. |
| Existing Swift protocol suite | 119 tests passed; all 25 shared fixture files unchanged. |
| Caller experiment | 31 observations and four cleanup checks passed; all nine focused tests passed with live checks enabled. |
| TPM/provider TLS and hardware-adapter control | Private simulator controls and eleven focused unit tests passed. Supervised `/dev/tpmrm0` create/reopen, signing and mutual TLS also passed, including the same keys after an operator reboot. |
| Linux-runnable Kotlin/Android tasks | Passed with JDK 21 and SDK 37; Gradle reused unchanged task results. Debug APK and lint tasks succeeded. |
| Original unconditional Gradle gate | Blocked on Linux by four absent Mac peers; replaced by the host-aware gate below. |
| Mac checks and remote CI | Not run; the added Linux protocol CI job is prepared only. |

The linked experiment reports bind their results to source hashes and record the
limits. These results do not establish a protected installation or real approval
execution. At this checkpoint the original unconditional local gate blocked Linux
pushes. The host-aware local gate below replaces that requirement while retaining
Mac CI checks before merge.

## Independent checks

Use Python 3.11 or later, Swift 6.2 or later, JDK 21, and an Android SDK containing
platform `android-37.0` and build tools `37.0.0`. The shared-host SQLite tests also
require development headers and library (`libsqlite3-dev` on Ubuntu), discoverable
through `pkg-config`. The shell's `python3` must select
the intended interpreter; this machine's `/usr/bin/python3` is 3.13, while another
Python earlier on its default PATH is older.

```sh
./scripts/check.sh
./scripts/check-linux-protocol.sh
./scripts/check-linux-host.sh
python3 scripts/run-linux-caller-experiment.py
./gradlew :protocol-kotlin:test :phone-core:test :android-app:testDebugUnitTest :android-app:assembleDebug :android-app:lintDebug
```

The caller runner uses only disposable processes in the current account. Its live
checks need ordinary Unix sockets and tracing of its own children; restricted
execution sandboxes may deny those operations. Such a denial is a failed or
unavailable experiment, not successful identity validation. Do not change global
ptrace or security policy to obtain a pass.

The [Swift experiment](experiments/linux-swift-protocol.md) records an isolated
official toolchain and the additional userspace libraries needed on Ubuntu 25.10.
The [caller experiment](experiments/linux-caller.md) records exact positive checks,
timeouts, cleanup and untested cases. The [TPM/TLS experiment](experiments/linux-tpm-tls.md)
has separate dependency and invocation instructions; simulator results must remain
labelled as simulator results. None of these commands installs a production daemon.

The separate [native Swift/provider experiment](../experiments/linux-native-tpm-tls/README.md)
uses an internal C/OpenSSL shim for actual provider-backed signing and one TLS
server exchange. Its private-simulator controls retain separate authority and
transport keys, reject software keys and wrong peers, require negotiated ALPN
even when the extension is omitted, and enforce bounded execution. It neither
reuses the historical hardware fixture nor extends that device evidence to the
native path. The portable runner tests are part of repository checks; the explicit
native build and simulator run require their documented development/runtime
dependencies. The Ubuntu 24.04 Linux Swift CI job installs those test dependencies,
extracts the checksum-pinned resource manager into a private prefix without
installing its service, and requires the native build and simulator controls.
That runner's result remains pending until the PR check passes. A production signing API,
TLS-stack choice, protected service identity and key-authorization policy remain
separate reviewed decisions.

The separate [controlled monitor experiment](experiments/linux-caller-monitor.md)
extends the caller work with supervised fixture launch, event invalidation and a
simulated stopped handoff. Its native fixture runs independently of a phone or
TPM; its successful controls still leave protected code and production admission
unsupported. Enable its live test explicitly as documented there. Existing
historical checkpoints above remain scoped to their original source revisions.

The [disposable approval-to-command experiment](experiments/linux-approval-command.md)
connects the shared verifier, consumption/outcome and submission-replay tables, audit tables and checkpoint/recovery
selection to a fixed ordinary-user command. It runs automatically after the shared-host
suite in `check-linux-host.sh`, on both the local Linux gate and Linux Swift CI job.
Synthetic software keys and requester claims, a private fixture ledger and one fixed command
do not establish production authority, physical-phone approval or protected caller admission.

The opt-in [composed caller/command experiment](experiments/linux-composed-caller-command.md)
joins the monitor's stopped frontend, its actual transferred pipes, independent
remote observation, current grants, shared consumption and the fixed command in
one owner. It refuses faults injected at named barriers. A loss after the last
check is recorded as an unknown outcome, never counted as strict admission, so
contract line 67 remains unproven. Like the monitor experiment, its live matrix
is run explicitly; its report validation runs in the repository Python tests.

## Local gate and CI coverage

The [storage lease experiment](../experiments/linux-storage-lease/README.md) also
runs in `check-linux-host.sh`. It retains existing private directories and files,
checks ownership, modes, ACL absence and object identity, and holds a cooperative
writer lock. Its 36 controls include 29 live ordinary-user filesystem controls
and seven explicitly injected error controls, including a wrong stored-object UID
and separate later-object device/filesystem-type differences after a normal anchor
sample. The requested-owner guard remains a separate live control; no actual
foreign-owned file, mount change or cross-device topology is tested. Filesystem and ACL prerequisites must be available,
and Python must be 3.11 or later; unsupported semantics fail rather than skip. These are fixture
mechanics, not a protected service identity, durable journal or production storage
policy. Advisory locking does not exclude a malicious same-account writer.

The [OS-capture experiment](experiments/linux-os-capture.md) also runs in
`check-linux-host.sh`. It observes its own current Linux task and retained objects,
round-trips raw paths and real UID/GID roles through schema 4, and refuses changed
objects or streams before a synchronous callback. It runs no command and uses
synthetic monitor, caller and code-policy fields. Its controls do not establish a
stopped caller handoff or protected admission; a monitor must independently
observe its retained sender before this can join the command fixture.

The [repository pre-push requirement](../AGENTS.md) is one manual command that
selects the checks executable on the current host. No Git hook is installed:

```sh
./scripts/check-local.sh
```

It runs `scripts/check.sh` first on both hosts. Linux also runs
`scripts/check-linux-protocol.sh` and `scripts/check-linux-host.sh`. Both run the
portable Kotlin/phone tests and Android unit tests, debug assembly and lint. macOS additionally runs
`:phone-core:approvalFlowTest` after `check.sh` has built its native peers.
Unknown platforms and any failed phase fail the gate immediately.

The [shared host core](../host/shared-core/README.md) contains the decision verifier,
its authority-owned request, enrollment and clock inputs, the sleep-inclusive clock
sampler, SQLite audit, consumption and command-submission replay tables, consumption outcome transitions,
checkpoint and history-intent codecs/evidence tables, and pure storage-reconciliation selection. These tests run through the Linux host check and
native Mac check; Mac tests also retain audit signing integration. Mac consumers
use the same implementations through compatibility type aliases and table
storage-error adapter. The table owner still supplies protected storage, durability
configuration and outer transactions.
Recovery selections are data-only recommendations; the Mac adapter retains its
serialized journal reads and protected-store transitions, with its existing store
integration tests. These extractions do not implement Linux protected persistence,
an authority or command dispatch. Shared consumption writes require an explicit
write transaction and the audit tables on the exact same connection and account.
Savepoints keep consumption/outcome mutations atomic with their audit append, even
if the caller catches an error and commits the outer transaction. Linux tests cover
competing write connections, replay across reopen, failure rollback and terminal
unknown outcomes; protected Linux connection ownership and durable commit/recovery
remain unimplemented. The Mac owner continues to load current enrollment and check
its revision in the write transaction, mark failures and coordinate checkpoints.
The disposable command experiment now uses these shared table implementations, with its
own fixture-only connection/checkpoint owner. Its seventeen process controls preserve the
original fourteen and add ID replay, nonce replay and expiry at the final shared consumption
call. Read-only Python SQLite observations independently check the stored row counts after
workers retire, including reservation rollback on expiry and audit failure. A reopened worker
rejects fresh signed requests reusing historical IDs/nonces and never restores an old token.
This integration does not add a protected Linux owner or a production continuity format.

`HistoryRecoveryJournalTables` also shares the existing retained history-gap table
and canonical intent bytes. The connection owner supplies an explicit transaction;
writes require a main-database write transaction. The Mac adapter keeps version
checks, migration ownership, storage-error mapping and failed-transaction handling.
Portable tests cover reopen, duplicate epochs, schema/row rollback, malformed data
and main-table qualification. This does not select a Linux persistent catalog,
authenticate an intent or authorize recovery of pending actions.

Shared command-submission replay tests exercise permanent ID/nonce reservations,
scope and capacity limits, competing connections, rollback, reopen, malformed rows
and SQLite failures. The original Mac replay table layout is retained, with no
shared schema-version migration or retention path. The Mac adapter keeps policy
prerequisites, protected installation, error mapping and failed-transaction handling;
its existing journal, checkpoint and caller-admission tests remain unchanged.
Supplied caller bindings and capture digests are historical metadata, not caller
authentication or execution authority. The connection owner must roll back the
whole admission transaction on any required failure and coordinate durable commits.

The complete Linux coordinator passed on 2026-10-18 for source revision `6984429`,
including the shared-source inventory fix and its regression controls, on this
Ubuntu 25.10 host with the prepared Swift 6.2.4 runtime, JDK 21 and Android SDK 37:
178 repository tests (six skips), 221 watcher tests, 130 Swift protocol tests,
eight shared verifier tests, and all portable Kotlin/Android tasks. The repository
tests include six controls for Linux/macOS command selection, running from another
directory, unsupported hosts and failure propagation. Stubbed macOS commands and
source-change controls test orchestration only; native Mac builds, interoperability
and live experiments were not executed on this Linux host. Their required Mac
validation remains separate from this result.

`ApprovalFlowPeer`, `TLSPeer`, `HPKEPeer` and `AuditFlowPeer` are macOS executables
built from `experiments/approval-flow`. Linux does not substitute or skip their
Gradle task: it runs the portable tasks locally, and the complete native
interoperability suite remains required in Mac CI before merge. Explicitly invoking
`:phone-core:approvalFlowTest` still fails when the peers are absent.

All automated local checks map to jobs in
[checks.yml](../.github/workflows/checks.yml), triggered on pull requests and pushes
to `main` without path filters:

| Local check | CI job and command |
| --- | --- |
| Repository Python and PR-watcher tests | **Python checks**: `./scripts/check.sh` on Ubuntu; also runs on Mac. |
| Linux Swift protocol and shared host tests | **Linux Swift protocol**: `./scripts/check-linux-protocol.sh` and `./scripts/check-linux-host.sh` on Ubuntu 24.04. |
| Mac native builds, experiments, Swift protocol, shared host and core tests | **Mac build**: the complete Darwin branch of `./scripts/check.sh` on macOS 26. |
| Portable Kotlin protocol and phone tests | **Kotlin protocol**: `:protocol-kotlin:jvmTest :phone-core:test :phone-ui:jvmTest :dev-invitation:test`. |
| Native Swift/Kotlin interoperability | **Mac interoperability**: builds all four peers from the checkout, then runs `:phone-core:test :phone-core:approvalFlowTest`. |
| Kotlin tests on the iOS simulator (macOS only) and the iOS app build | **iOS build**: `:protocol-kotlin:iosSimulatorArm64Test :phone-ui:iosSimulatorArm64Test`, then an unsigned simulator build of `ios/Remozio.xcodeproj` on macOS 26. |
| Android unit tests, debug assembly and lint | **Android build**: `:android-app:testDebugUnitTest :android-app:assembleDebug :android-app:lintDebug`, plus the additional CI-only `:android-app:assembleRelease`. |

The PR watcher's `local_gate` uses the same coordinator and its `required_checks`
includes all seven job names. The original five jobs passed in upstream
[Checks run 39034970117](https://github.com/rock3r/remozio/actions/runs/39034970117)
for base revision `2d00126c8ce010f356a5de0db8e432dd37b504cc`. This branch's added
Linux Swift job has been validated locally but has not yet run remotely.
CI configuration and historical base results do not establish a pass for this branch.

Mac automated validation therefore does not require a friend's machine before a
Linux push; it remains a merge gate on the PR revision. The XPC GUI checks and
device-dependent experiments still require their specified interactive operator
sessions. A passing local Linux gate does not establish Mac runtime compatibility.

## Human testing boundary

The shared explicit-grant codec retains the Mac policy format and authorization
checks. Linux own-account helpers refuse root and other-account targets, resolve
current NSS credentials, and require fresh policy and authenticated retained-caller
observations. Portable tests cover the existing canonical bytes and disclosure,
scope and revocation; Linux tests cover fresh reads, changed credentials or targets,
missing observations, malformed/unavailable NSS results and native own-account NSS.
The supplied loader and credential-reader seams do not establish protected loading,
monitor ownership or caller authentication. Production integration and the stopped
handoff remain separate gates; no Linux protected policy path is selected here.

Supervised `/dev/tpmrm0` creation, fresh-process reopen, signing and mutual TLS,
including reuse of the same keys after the operator's reboot,
passed with the operator's temporary per-user device ACL. The
[device checkpoint](experiments/linux-tpm-tls-device-evidence.json) records all negative
controls, unchanged retained records and unchanged persistent/NV handle listings.
The boot identifier changed, and all retained records matched their original hashes
before and after the reboot test. The same two keys signed and verified, and mutual
TLS plus all negative controls passed. No replacement keys were generated.
Protected service access, resource contention and physical cross-machine controls
remain separate device-dependent checks.
The [operator procedure](experiments/linux-tpm-tls.md#prepared-human-hardware-gate) requires
explicit hardware mode, authorized ordinary-user resource-manager access and
known-empty owner authorization for this provider adapter. Unknown or nonempty
owner authorization is unsupported by this adapter; do not guess it or reset it.
It must use disposable objects and verify the expected public identities. Do not
clear the TPM, reset ownership, evict unrelated handles, or automatically replace
an existing trusted host identity. Simulator keys and state are disposable fixtures;
they must never be enrolled as a production identity.

Record create/reopen, signing, mutual authentication, negative peers, unavailable
hardware and bounded resource behavior. The recorded reboot retention applies only
to the disposable fixture on this selected device. Protected service access and
physical cross-machine copied-record rejection still need explicit controls. A real TPM
result does not establish a protected Linux installation or a phone approval flow.
Using `/dev/tpmrm0` is device-path evidence, not physical-hardware attestation;
the operator must identify the test platform accurately, including any virtual TPM.

For future repeats, the retained fixture is under the operator's private user state directory,
`~/.local/state/remozio-experiments/tpm-tls-fixture`. Keep it through the reboot;
reuse must not regenerate either key. Sibling files retain the before-boot identity
hashes and boot comparison metadata. The `runtime-debs` sibling preserves the
isolated runtime packages and `runtime-package-hashes.json` records their checksums
so the same runtime can be restored if `/tmp` is cleared. After returning, re-establish
the temporary device ACL if needed, verify the public prerequisites and package
hashes, compare the boot identity, and run the documented `--reuse-fixture` invocation
with `--operator-phase after-reboot`. Publish comparison booleans only, never
the raw boot identifier or retained key records. Remove the temporary ACL after
the supervised tests finish.

Physical Pixel pairing and biometrics become actionable after the Linux services,
negotiated capture contract and executor are implemented. The current experiments
are not ready to approve or run real user commands. Privileged installation,
service activation, reboot and phone interaction remain supervised milestones.

## Review boundaries

Keep the design proposal, caller experiment, TPM experiment and shared protocol
portability independently reviewable. Coordinate shared schema work before assigning
wire tags; the [capture proposal](linux-capture-proposal.md) gives the concrete
upstream decisions and required fixtures. Submit implementation PRs sequentially and use the repository PR watcher
for readiness. Hardware results, Mac validation and schema agreement remain explicit
gates rather than implied consequences of unit-test success.
