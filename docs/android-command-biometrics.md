# Android command biometric authorization

`AndroidCommandBiometrics` owns one enrolled biometric key and one authenticated command session. The native `CommandBiometricPrompt` owns that identity for the screen. The integration must create it for the exact session whose command is displayed, then invoke it only from that command's execute control.

Preparation builds a decision from retained Mac, account, request, digest, challenge, phone, and key identities. The only action is execute for the current request. Preparation requires a signed pending status, a usable elapsed clock, and nonzero remaining authorization time. These checks do not prove delivery freshness. The Mac remains authoritative for expiry, first-arrival selection, enrollment validity, and the final target check.

The native prompt requests strong biometrics with the prepared Signature as its CryptoObject. It accepts only the same Signature and a biometric success result. Before signing, it checks pending status and the retained decision again under the session monitor. The resulting protocol signature is verified against the enrolled public key before returning a carrier. No raw signing function or replaceable callback payload is exposed.

Attempt tickets cover asynchronous preparation. Cancelled tickets cannot start late operations. Stop, destruction, explicit close, and request replacement cancel the prompt. The caller must close on enrollment changes and Compose disposal. A 250 ms check dismisses the prompt when the request is no longer actionable; completion also checks synchronously. Late, repeated, substituted, closed, expired, and terminal callbacks cannot produce a carrier. Cancellation releases the local operation without signing.

This component does not send the decision, connect the launcher to live enrollment, or release a credential. Ordinary decline remains on the separate decision-key path without biometrics. Enrollment retention and the single-prompt credential-release gate remain unproven.

JVM tests use software keys to verify exact bindings, signature domains, substituted keys and operations, inactive enrollment, cancellation, request closure, terminal status, and elapsed-clock changes. They do not establish device biometric enforcement or native dialog behavior. Native prompt and lifecycle checks remain for the interactive Pixel session.

## Inspector controls

`CommandRequestInspection` accepts an optional enrollment-bound `CommandApprovalContext`. The same session supplies the displayed capture and both decisions. Samples remain read-only. Controls appear only for permitted pending actions and active enrollment. The integration supplies the authenticated sender; no production connection is opened by this view.

Approve uses the native biometric prompt. Decline loads only the decision key and does not depend on biometric-key availability. The controls distinguish preparing, signing, sending, awaiting Mac confirmation, and uncertain delivery. A successful write does not claim approval or execution. Explicit retry sends the same in-memory carrier without signing a different decision. No decision is persisted or retried automatically.

Stop cancels local work and the prompt. If a carrier exists, delivery remains uncertain until an authenticated status resolves it. Disposal drops local state; this does not undo a decision already received by the Mac. Controls disappear once the Mac accepts a decision or reports a terminal state. Each request and enrollment owns separate view state.

The controls use existing Material 3 buttons and static status text. Their bounded scroll area preserves access at larger text sizes without expanding beyond half the window. The sheet/dialog adaptation and close action remain. No custom animation is added. Layout, TalkBack, and native dialog interaction remain unverified on a device.
